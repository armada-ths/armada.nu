          Armada was founded in 1981 and has since then organized a career fair
          that has grown to become one of the largest in scandinavia. We exist
          to connect students to their dream employer and have since come up
          with different events and happenings to create personal connections
          between students and employers.

        <P className="mt-4">
          Each year, Armada goes from 1 student, the Project Manager, to over
          200 student volunteers managing a fair over two days, in several
          locations and 20 000 visitors. As Armada is fully owned by{" "}

          <P>
            The Project Manager (PM) is elected by the THS board in november.
            The PM is working full time with Armada and is responsible for the
            entire project. They usually have been part of Armada before taking
            up this role.

          <P>
            The Project Group (PG) is chosen by the Project Manager in
            December/January. They then work with Armada the whole calendar
            year. These are students who dedicate around 10 hours per week to
            making each Armada the best fair yet. The PG really gets close
            learning to work together, get to try to shoulder big
            responsibilities in a supportive and collaborative environment and
            most of all, have really fun together. Everyone whoâ€™s been a PG
            knows, there is a before and an after Armada.

          <P>
            The operations team are volunteers recruited in the spring, around
            April/May. They are Coordinators, responsible for a specific issue
            or process, Team Leaders, responsible for a team of Hosts and
            Developers, working with the Armada IT suite. Being an OT gives a
            good understanding of how Armada works within, and is the perfect
            first leadership experience. It is a lot of fun, and gives a lot of
            learning opportunities, for a medium amount of work.

          <P>
            The Hosts join Armada in the autumn, and being a Hosts is a special
            experience. Most hosts are career fair hosts, helping a couple of
            exhibitors to the fair and building the fair. You get to know your
            team, attend team buildings together and be a part of the Armada

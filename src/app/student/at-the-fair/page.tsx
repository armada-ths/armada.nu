            Walking up to a representative of a company you really want to work
            for can be intimidating! But don't fret, below we’ve collected some
            tips on how to get the most out of your conversation.
          </P>

            <li>

          <P>
            Remember that you are not chatting with an AI who just knows facts
            about the company, but with another person. Think of it as a date
            with a company!

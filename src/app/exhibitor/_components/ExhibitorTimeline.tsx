          build your booth up from the materials already in place. Then you can
          go to the exhibitor lounge and have a sandwich and a cup of coffee to

          At 10am the students start rolling in, and your brand will be on
          display. Some are looking for general career advice, some younger
          students just want to know who you are. Some wonder what consultants
          really do, and some have only one goal in mind - finding a master
          thesis.
